Installing the Data Science Toolbox
 
1) Install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2) Install Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

3) Open up a terminal or command prompt and create a directory for your toolbox; enter that directory
        $ mkdir DataScienceToolbox
        $ cd DataScienceToolbox

4) Tell vagrant you want to use the toolbox that comes with the book
        $ vagrant init data-science-toolbox/data-science-at-the-command-line

5) Boot your toolbox
        $ vagrant up

6) Access into your toolbox.  If you are using windows, you will need to follow the instructions in the book on connecting with Putty.
        $ vagrant ssh

You should now have something that looks like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8zn7j6u86tmrmp9/Screenshot%20from%202015-01-22%2011%3A56%3A32.png?dl=0

Notes for Jan 22: <-- These are good notes.
finishing up the lecture for last class:

define evolution
============

+ descent with modification
+ recent modifications that changes over time allele frequencies changes 

+ takes a long time
+ macro and micro evolution; there are same process depends what time frame of changes you are studying. Micro => changes in organism? Macro=> Something going from bacteria to plants.
+ changes in allele frequencies over time due to evolutionary forces such as natural selection, genetic drift, migration.  
+ change in the passing of heritable traits in species over time
+ Reed's favorite: Change of inheritable modifications over time.
Heritble traits include allele frequencies, but also others. For instance, inbreeding can change genotype frequencies, without changing allele frequencies. 


what are the five forces of evolution?
============================

1. natural selection; variation in genotype leading to greater fitness,  operates on phenotype
2. mutation - events that change genetic material; creates variation; is a force; transposons/recombination
3. genetic drift - random change in allele frequencies in a population; is stronger in smaller population
4. migration/gene flow /lack of migration or population structure - 
5. non-random mating - inbreeding; self-crossing; avoidance of mating with close relatives; changes genotype freqs, but not allele freqs. increases homozygosity

+ mutation; inheritable material changes and creats the raw material of evolution
causes larger jumps in the allele frequency.
+ operates like mutation can move alleles in. absence of migartion is also a force. 


Why do we care about mutation?
=========================

+ It is random and unpredictable, and can drastically affect an organisms well-being
+ Many diseases are linked to mutation
+ artificially create mutation to understand biology and application in biotechnology 
mutation allows spices can survive and a
+ mutation allows for adaptation by producing variants that may be better adapted to a changing environment
+ can cause malfunctions or new abilities (beneficial or deleterious)
+ mutation is data. patterns of mutation allow inference of the history of the DNA
+ can trace ancestry/lineages via differences in genetic mutations
+ tells of the history of the populations. connect up people to figure out multiple marriages, 
+ crime investigations

# END LECTURE ONE

LECTURE TWO
============

    1. be able to use the command line to manage data
    2. be able to write script to parse data 
+ use commands and Write scripts to work with them

Big Data
=======

+ big data; $1 bil for one person in the beginning; took 10 years
+ cost dramatically decreased so we can produce massive amount of data very very fast
+ currently takes approximately 8 days
+ cheaper to freeze than sequencing again
+ more data exists.
+ important to know how to handle these data so we need to know the skills and statistics 
+ do not want to 'blackbox' your process for data transformation
+ 
tracking data science is very valuable


OSEMN (pronounced awesome)
=========================
obtaining data
scrubbing data
exploring data
modeling data
interpreting data

Workshop
========
1. Shell 
2. Files and Dirs
3. Creation
4. Pipes and filters
5. Loops
6. Scripts
7. Searching for things

+ machins name [  ] and then path ~ and $ represent the prompt
+ install virtualbox and vagrant

+ virtual box has images just like on a machine; vagrant is a wrapper to run those images
+ $ mkdir creates directory that vagrant lives there
+ $ cd  <directory>   goes to that directory
+ $ vagrant init 

+ windows users use the putty program
    + host name: 127.0.0.1
    + port: 2222
    + connection type: ssh

+ mac or linux users do $ vagrant ssh


Why do we use the command line?
===============================

The reason we use the command line is... very efficient analysis pipelines 
and it allows us to quickly do a lot of programs that you canâ€™t do manually with a mouse.

### Getting started
Working on the shell means typing the names of programs, which produce ouputs that are eitehr printed to screen or passed on to other programs. Some basic programs include

+ $ clear is the command to clear the screen
+ we have scroll bar on the right side
+ linux has different formats of shell (Bash, cshell(csh) )
+ Bash is most common,  has some "extras" that make very powerful
+ how do you know what shell you are in
+ $ echo $SHELL
+ $ whoami  tells your username; is a program that shell found
+ $ pwd  is print working directory. Where you work at

Navigating around the file system

+ short hand for home directory is tilda
+ cd ~   to get home or cd   alone
+ ls gives you the contents of your directory
+ /etc is "etsee" not "et cetera"
+ /home/user  is an absolute directory because it starts with a / (root dir)
+ "relative paths" have no leading '/', path is taken to start from current dir
 (so, from /home/user cd Music and cd /home/user/Music are equiv.)
+ cd .. (double dots) goes to the parent directory / goes up one level
+ single dot refers to current directory and is invoked $ cd ./somedirectory
You can add "arguments" or "options" to programs to change their behaviour, for istance
+ ls -F (ls with option F) gives you file/  if you dont see them in different color
 (see $ ls --help or man ls for more info)
+ in Linux path and directories are case sensitive
+ $ man ls   you can see manual for ls
+ any files starts with a dot will be ignored (e.g. ., .., .hiddenfile)
+ an arg is passed to a function; a parameter is what the arg is called inside the function
+ ls stands for 'list'
+ ls -F -a also shows the previous directory
+ root's parent is root. Long Live the root.
+ $ less takes us to the content of the file

Making files, getting rid of them and moving them around

+ $ mkdir (make directory) makes a new directory
+ $ touch  creat an empty file (can later add text or other data)
+ $ nano is a command line text editor ,
+ $ in nano, ctrl+k cuts a line and ctrl+u to paste the cut line <-how to repeat a line?
  wiki documentation for nano: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Basics_Guide
  Other command line editors: vi(m) and emacs (pick a side: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war), and GUI driven text editors good too, Atom, gvim, gedit, notepad++ (on windows) pick sublimetext.
+ rm remove the file (be careful with that; it's permanent)
+ be very, very careful with rm -r  <-- it recursively the deletes the files below.
+ mv file destination
+ mv file  ..   takes it to 2d upper dir
+ cp copies files
+ you can mv and replace at the same time  $ mv ../flie ./file
+ ls -R recursively lists directory contents.
+ cp multiple file to one file     $ cp file file file destination
